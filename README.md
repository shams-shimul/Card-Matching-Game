# Card Matching Game

**ðŸŽ¯ JavaScriptmas 2024 challenge from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/ "target=_blank"), Day 11**

This is a classic "Find the Pair" game with a christmas theme. The game starts with an even number of cards flipped backwards. Each card reveals an emoji when clicked. There are pairs of each emoji covered by the cards and the player needs to match them with consecutive clicks until all the hidden emojis are revealed and the game ends.
